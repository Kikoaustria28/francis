                   <p style="font-family:verdana">  My favourite quotation is from the movie "Meet the Robinsons". <br>
                    I'm so inspired by this movie because of the lesson. The quote said, "Keep Moving Forward." <br> 
                    Ever since I heard that word, I always think of it if I am having a hard time. <br> 
                    Whatever happens or the hardships in life, I need to keep moving forward. </p>

                       <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My strong points are that I am a friendly person and easy to talk to. <br>
                           I also have a good memory if I say it every time. <br>
                           I am also a fast learner if I am taught properly. <br>
                           I'm also good at listening comprehension. </p> </div>

                       <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My weakness is that I don't have much confidence. <br>
                           I always second-guess myself every time I know the answer to a question, <br>
                           but I always stay quiet and then, when the question is answered, I am right. <br>
                           I just don't have the courage to raise my hand and talk to everyone in class. <br>
                           I always procrastinate when doing a long deadline of seatwork or an assignment. <br>
                           And I also have the thought of being a failure when an activity or seatwork is a low score. </p>

                           <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My hobbies are that I like to watch videos that are very entertaining. <br>
                               Sometimes the video is about coding, which I find entertaining and motivating. <br>
                               I also like to listen to music, specifically relaxing lofi music, <br>
                               because it helps me to be relaxed and forget about a certain problem. <br> 
                               I also listen to music while doing homework or schoolwork, it somehow helps me think.</p>

                           <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My showbiz personalities and idols will be IU and Tzuyu. <br>
                               They are a K-pop idol in South Korea.<br> IU's real name is Lee Ji-eun, and Tzuyu's real name is Chou Tzu-yu. <br>

                               They became my showbiz personalities because of their singing skills. <br>
                               They really have a good voice, and, from what I see, some of the videos of them interacting with fans
                               indicate that they are really nice. Every now and then, I follow them on their social media accounts. Tom
                               holland because he plays spider-man in marvel, and spider man is my favourite superhero. </p>
